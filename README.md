# CIS220Test
# This project is made in NodeJS, but I have described the differences in the file comments

### For this program, you will create an array of ordersm consisting of order number and order 
### status (i.e [['order_1','unfulfilled'],['order_2','fulfilled']])

### You will then make a 4 digit, 7 segment display show the total number of orders in this 
### array that have the status = 'unfulfilled'

### Every one(1) second, you will (at random) add a new order with a random status, and use a 
### speaker to indicate whether it has changed the amount of orders in the array, and a green and
### red LED to indicate whether the amount of orders increased or decreased.
